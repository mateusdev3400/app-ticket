# App Ticket

## About

This application is an example of what happens at concerts and cinemas. This project contains an emphasis on 3 different entrances (lane, upper and lower) where each has a certain amount of entry.

If the user tries to add more inputs than the project is prepared to receive, it will not allow the user to continue with their action, that is, blocking access to the button. There is a ticket limit, and this was defined in the array.
